Today is the last exercise of computer network on Distance Vector Routing.
In this you can set four nodes in a network and check the link cost based on the latency of sending a message to one and another. 
Once you have the latency, use it as a cost and implement the program using socket (TCP). 
Requirement is to simulate the working of Distance vector routing through socket programming. 


STEP 1: Setup the 4 nodes in a network

- For this let us setup 4 virtual network interfaces and assign ip address to them
- Run the setup.sh script to setup the four network nodes

STEP 2: Let us find the link cost as the RTT

- Let us ar
